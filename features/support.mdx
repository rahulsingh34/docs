## Setup

<Steps>
    <Step title="Register">
        Head over to <a href="https://www.trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> and create an account.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get API Keys">
    https://trello.com/power-ups/admin
        Go to the <a href="https://www.trello.com/" target="_blank">Power Ups Admin Panel</a> and create a new power up.

        After you create a power up, go to the API Key section and generate a token. 

        Paste the API Key and Token in your `.env` file.
        ```terminal .env
        TRELLO_KEY=[API KEY]
        TRELLO_TOKEN=[TOKEN]
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a board and list">
        Navigate back to the Trello dashboard and create a new board as well as at least one list named "Queue". 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get board and list IDs">
        While on your board, you will have a URL similar to to the following: `https://trello.com/b/[board-id]/[board-name]`.

        Using the board-id, API key, and token, run this API call in your browser:
        `https://api.trello.com/1/boards/[YOUR BOARD-ID]/lists?key=[YOUR API KEY]&token=[YOUR TOKEN]`

        This will return details about the lists within the your board. Copy the ID of the list you have named "Queue" and paste it into your  `.env` file:
        ```terminal .env
        TRELLO_QUEUE=[QUEUE ID]
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage
With the setup complete, the <a href="/components/extras#support" target="_blank">support modal form</a> will take submissions and send them to the "Queue" list within your Trello board. You can use this board to stay organized while managing user requests.

The `src/routes/api/trello` route provides an example of how you can utilize Trello's API within your app. For further enhancements, Trello's API docs can be found <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/" target="_blank">here</a>.
