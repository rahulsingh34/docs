Location: `src/components/Pricing.svelte`

## Setup
To change the price cards and their details you can edit the `cards` array:
```typescript Pricing.svelte
<script lang="ts>
    ...
    let cards = [
        {
            id: 'basic', // SET ID TO THE SAME VALUE AS DEFINED IN YOUR src/routes/api/stripe/+server.ts
            name: 'Basic', // DISPLAY NAME
            original: 100, // ORIGINAL PRICE
            price: 50, // SALE PRICE
            included: ['Feature 1', ...], // FEATURES INCLUDED 
            excluded: ['Feature 2'...], // FEATURES EXCLUDED
            highlighted: true // TRUE OR FALSE BASED ON THE CARD YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AS "POPULAR" 
        },
        ...
    ];
    ...
</script>
```

<Warning>For the Stripe checkout function to work, the `id` property must be the same as you defined in `src/routes/api/stripe/+server.ts`. See the <a href="/features/payments#usage" target="_blank">Payments section</a> for more details.</Warning>
