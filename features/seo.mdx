## Meta Tags
Within your `src/app.html` file, you will find a few meta tags that will be present throughout your app:
```html app.html
<meta name="application-name" content="">
<meta name="description" content="">
<meta name="keywords" content="">
```

You using the head fragment, you can add different meta tags for pages and layouts:
```html
<svelte:head>
    <!- YOUR META TAGS HERE ->
</svelte:head>
```

## OpenGraph Tags
OpenGraph Tags are used for social sharing and its how you get good looking displays when you share a URL.

In `src/routes/blogs/[slug]/+page.svelte` OpenGraph tags are dynamically generated through the data you provide on the <a href="/features/blog#blog-structure-example" target="_blank">blog structure</a>.

You using the head fragment, you can add different OpenGraph Tags for pages and layouts outside of the blog:
```html
<svelte:head>
    <!- YOUR OPENGRAPH TAGS HERE ->
</svelte:head>
```

## Rich Text Snippets
Ever notice how when you search up a receipe on Google there's a unique section that shows you receipes with reviews, time to make, ingredients, and more? These Rich Results help generate clicks for your site.

There's a handy function in your $lib called `serializeSchema` that will take in a rich result schema and format it for your site. You can see it in action on `src/routes/blogs/[slug]/+page.svelte`, where it dynamically generates the blog (NewsArticle) schema from the data you provide on the <a href="/features/blog#blog-structure-example" target="_blank">blog structure</a>.

More schemas can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery" target="_blank">here</a>.
