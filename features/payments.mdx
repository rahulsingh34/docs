## Setup
<Steps>
    <Step title="Register">
        Head over to <a href="https://www.stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a> and create an account and complete the registration.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update Settings">
        Be sure to go through the Payments settings and setup your branding and payment options.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test Mode + API Keys">
        Switch Stripe to Test Mode and go to the Developers tab. Get your Secret key and paste it into the `.env` file:
        ```terminal .env
        STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[TEST SECRET KEY]
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a product">
        Head over to the product catalog and create at least one product. Go to `src/routes/api/stripe/+server.ts` and add in your product's price ID along with a name of your choice (id).

        ```typescript src/routes/api/stripe/+server.ts
        const items = [
            {
                id: 'any_unique_name', price_id: 'your_price_id'
            },
            ... // ADD MORE AS NEEDEED
        ]
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage
With the setup complete, you will now be able to call the stripe checkout using a function in your $lib called `checkout` which takes a string as an argument.

Say you have a product setup in your `src/routes/api/stripe/+server.ts` as:
```typescript src/routes/api/stripe/+server.ts
const items = [
    {
        id: 'basic', price_id: 'price_XXXXXXXXXXX'
    }
]
 ```
You can call the stripe checkout anywhere in your app using: `checkout('basic')`

## Webhooks
Stripe webhooks are listened to on `src/routes/webhook/stripe/+server/.ts`.

In the file above, you will see how you can listen to events that you are interested in using if or case statements.

In the Stripe Developers section, you can click "Add endpoint" and test your webhooks locally before adding the actual endpoint url. 

For testing and listening to events locally with the Stripe CLI, use `localhost:5173/webhook/stripe`. When you are ready to move into production your endpoint URL should be: `https://[your-domain.com]/webhook/stripe`.
